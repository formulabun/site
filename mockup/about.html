            <h3> Origins of the Formulabun srb2kart server </h3>
            <p>
            Formula bun started by me as a private server between friends.
            I started hosting it because the current public EU servers at the time weren't up to our standars.
            </p>
            <p>
            When the server became more mature I decided to open it up to the public.
            It received a lot of traffic, filling up the server daily.
            </p>
            <p>
            However, I started to lose interest in the game, and my own enthousiasm to play the game and update the server decreased.
            </p>
            <p>
            When the 1.4 version of srb2kart rolled out I was quick to update the server.
            This update came with an annoying netgame instability I was unable to do anything against.
            </p>
            <p>
            This ruined my motivation even more and I decided to bring the srb2kart server back to private.
            </p>
            <p>
            After some months and another srb2kart version I opened the server again, to a moderate number of players. 
            This is the current situation of the server, and I think it is better like this.
            </p>
            <p>
            Now it is just a silly personal project in hosting, and an environment for some developments.

            <h3> Technologies and service hosting formulabun </h3>
            <p> Formulabun is being hosted on a VPN by contabo running an ubuntu image. </p>
            <p>
            The srb2kart instance is running in a docker container from a docker compose setup.
            In the same docker compose setup also contains small services written in golang.
            Docker compose is basically just used to save command line parameters to docker.
            </p>
            <p>
            The golang code resides in multiple packages, all with the go.formulabun.club prefix.
            That url redirects the go command to the github hosting the code, but redirects browsers to godoc.formulabun.club.
            The latter url contains documentation for the go packages as generated by the godoc tool.

            <h3> Past features </h3>
            <p> One of the most successful features of the formulabun were the random events </p>
            <p>
            With this, every evening a new srb2kart gameplay modification would be activated.
            These modifications included elimination, hpmod, combi, battle and some special combinations.
            It was inspired by the real karting hours of some other server that turned the kart speed to hard in the evening.
            </p>
            <p>
            This kept interest in the mods fresh, but only for some time.
            People would grow annoyed with a couple of mods and refuse to play on the server the night it was active.
            This basically split up the player base into niches, so some players would end up barely playing together.
            There was also a bit of hate on the announcement of the daily event by people not wanting to play it.
            I'm sure they did not have any negative intent but reading those messages wasn't nice.
            One mistake of me was trying to appeal to everyone's preferences, hence this system.
            </p>
            <p>
            Other custom features are mods I developed myself.
            The best received is a different way of doing battle, where it is point based instead of life based.
            This mod, other experiments, and tweaks to existing mods are available in a github repository.

            <h3> My background </h3>
            <p> When I started hosting I was in the last year of my master's degree in computer science engineering. </p>
            <p> I've written plenty of programs in a variety of programming languages, but never had I hosted a server. </p>
            <p>
            Fortunately I was quite experienced with a linux environment since this was my main OS throughout university.
            Currently I am running Arch Linux btw.
            </p>
            <p>
            Developments around the server were first being written in JavaScript, but I later pivoted to Go.

            <h3> Discord Bot </h3>
            <p>
            The best integration for the formulabun server is, in my opinion, the discord bot.
            If you want help running this bot for your own server feel free to reach out and I'll be glad to help.
